                Oh, hello! I didn't see you come in. Well, don't just stand there, take off your jacket, have a seat, and let's get into
                it, shall we?
            </p>
            <p>
                My name is Rich Coleman and I currently live in Chicago, Illinois, making a living as an Ad Ops
                Manager at Upshot Agency. If you're asking yourself,"<em>What in God's name is an Ad Ops Manager?</em>,"
                don't worry! You're not alone. Putting it simply, I make sure that all of those advertisements you see on
                the internet are functioning properly for my specific clients. Yes, you're right, it IS a noble profession!
                Thanks for saying so.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not spening 40ish hours a week behind a computer in a aggressively air-conditioned office in River North, I'm spending
                10 hours in a moderately comfortable classroom at Northwestern University, learning web development and computer
                programming in a part-time program. We experts call it a "coding bootcamp."
            </p>
            <p>
                "<em>Good heavens, Rich, a full-time job making sure doo-dads on the internet work AND you're learning how
                    to code? Surely you have no other activities or committments?</em>" Ohhhh, my friend, that's where you're
                wrong! I also spend a good chunk of time on stage doing Improv comedy at iO Theater, the home
                of longform improvisation.
            </p>
            <p>"<em>Oh... Improv, huh. Well, I, uh, better get going-</em>" Nonsense, friend! You are under no obligation
                to come to any of my improv shows! Relax. However, if you would like to see me, you can see me perform with
                <em>'66 Mustang</em>, one of iO's Harold teams. It's hard to explain what a Harold team is to the non-improvisers,
                but just know that making a team is highly-coveted and me being on one absolutely makes me better than you.</p>
            <p>
                I hope you'll take a look around my portfolio! If you're interested in working with me in any capacity -- I currently am
                taking on freelance web development, ad ops, and improv coaching work! -- then please contact me! Or just
                say hi!
            </p>
