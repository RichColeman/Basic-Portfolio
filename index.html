                    Oh, hello! I didn't see you come in. Well, don't just stand there, take off your jacket, have a seat, and let's get into
                    it, shall we?
                </p>
                <p>
                    My name is Rich Coleman and I currently live in Chicago, Illinois, making a living as an Ad Ops Manager at Upshot Agency.
                    If you're asking yourself,"<em>What in God's name is an Ad Ops Manager?</em>," don't
                    worry! You're not alone. Putting it simply, I make sure that all of those advertisements you see on the
                    internet are functioning properly for my specific clients. Yes, you're right, it IS a noble profession!
                    Thanks for saying so.
                </p>

                    When I'm not spening 40ish hours a week behind a computer in a aggressively air-conditioned office in River North, I'm spending
                    10 hours in a moderately comfortable classroom at Northwestern University, learning web development and
                    computer programming in a part-time program. We experts call it a "coding bootcamp."
